## Usage

Basic example:

```hcl
module "action_group" {
  source = "github.com/deviant101/terraform-azurerm-action-group"

  name                = "my-action-group"
  resource_group_name = "my-resource-group"
  short_name          = "myag"
  enabled             = true

  email_receivers = [
    {
      name                    = "admin-email"
      email_address           = "admin@example.com"
      use_common_alert_schema = true
    }
  ]

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

- `arm_role_receivers` - Azure RBAC role-based receivers
- `webhook_receivers` - Webhook receivers (Teams, Slack, etc.)
- `azure_function_receivers` - Azure Function receivers
- `logic_app_receivers` - Logic App workflow receivers
- `automation_runbook_receivers` - Automation runbook receivers
- `event_hub_receivers` - Event Hub streaming receivers
- `tags` - Resource tags

üìã **For complete input specifications and types, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#module-inputs-reference)**

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| id | The ID of the Action Group |
| name | The name of the Action Group |
| resource_group_name | The resource group name |

## Receiver Types

### Notification Receivers

These receivers send notifications directly to people:

- **Email Receiver**: Sends email notifications
- **SMS Receiver**: Sends text messages (carrier charges may apply)
- **Voice Receiver**: Makes automated voice calls
- **Azure App Push Receiver**: Sends push notifications to Azure mobile app
- **ARM Role Receiver**: Notifies all users with a specific Azure RBAC role

### Action Receivers

These receivers trigger automated actions:

- **Webhook Receiver**: HTTP POST to custom endpoints (Teams, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
- **Azure Function Receiver**: Executes serverless functions for custom logic
- **Logic App Receiver**: Triggers Logic App workflows
- **Automation Runbook Receiver**: Runs automation scripts for remediation
- **Event Hub Receiver**: Streams alerts to Event Hubs for analytics

## Common Alert Schema

The **Common Alert Schema** standardizes alert payloads across Azure Monitor. When enabled (`use_common_alert_schema = true`), all alerts use a consistent JSON format, making it easier to:

- Parse alerts in webhooks and functions
- Build reusable alert processing logic
- Integrate with third-party tools

**Recommendation**: Keep this enabled (default) unless you have specific legacy integrations.

Learn more: [Common Alert Schema Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema)

## Common Use Cases

1. **Critical Production Alerts**: Email + SMS + Voice for immediate attention
2. **Team Notifications**: Webhooks to Teams/Slack for team awareness
3. **Automated Remediation**: Automation Runbooks to auto-fix known issues
4. **Incident Management**: Logic Apps to create tickets in ServiceNow/Jira
5. **Alert Analytics**: Event Hubs to stream alerts to Log Analytics or Sentinel
6. **Custom Processing**: Azure Functions for alert enrichment and routing

## Notes

- **Short Name Limit**: The `short_name` must be 12 characters or less (validated by the module)
- **Phone Numbers**: For SMS and voice receivers, provide the country code and phone number separately
- **Webhook Security**: Consider using Azure Functions or Logic Apps with managed identities for secure webhook endpoints
- **Rate Limits**: Azure enforces rate limits on notifications (e.g., max 1 SMS per 5 minutes per number)
- **Testing**: Use the "Test action group" feature in Azure Portal to verify configurations

### Rate Limits

Azure enforces the following rate limits per action group:

- **SMS**: 1 per 5 minutes per phone number
- **Voice**: 1 per 5 minutes per phone number  
- **Email**: Maximum 100 per hour
- **Azure app push**: Maximum 100 per hour

## Examples

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for comprehensive examples including:

- Basic email notifications
- Multi-channel alerts (Email, SMS, Voice)
- Teams and Slack webhook integration
- Azure Function integration
- Logic App workflows
- Automation Runbook for auto-remediation
- Event Hub streaming
- ARM role-based notifications
- Complete production setup
- Multi-environment deployments
